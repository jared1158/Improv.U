<h1>Top Conspiracy Theories </h1>

<h2>Who killed JFK?</h2>

    <p class="lead"> Ah yes, the age old question about the unexplainable assasination of
        John Fitzgerald Kennedy. According the a Gallup poll, 61% percent of Americans
        believe that Kennedy's death is  the result of a conspiracy.
        Let us break down the possible conspirators. Lyndon B Johnson
          Born in Texas on August 27, 1908, LBJ was elected vice
      president of the United States in 1960, and became the 36th
      president in 1963,after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
       If film has taught us anything, it is that men love power--power
       that exists only for the President of The United States of America.
       A major theorist, <code>Roger Stone</code>, brought forth that LBJ hired hitman
      Malcolm Wallace to assassinate Kennedy. Reasons why his theory might be true:

    Johnson ducked before shots
    He confided to his mistress, Madeleine Duncan Brown: <br/>
    "After tomorrow I won't have to deal with those Kennedy snobs no more."

<h2> KGB VS JFK </h2>

    <p class="lead">
    Lee Harvey Oswald lived in the Soviet Union from 1959
    to 1962. During this time, Oswald married a russian woman
In a letter Oswald left his wife, he left the assertion
  <i> that: "I believe that  the Embassy will come quickly." </i>
  Pacepa believes this note is a piece of evidence that the KGB
  told Oswald they would take care of his family."

   Lee Harvey Oswald is every conspiracy theorist's
biggest nightmare. In addition,  to being tied with the KGB,
 Oswald was also arrested in 1963 for passing out pro-Castro
 pamphlets and was seen visiting the Cuban embassy on multiple
 ocassions where he allegedly had a meltdown after not being
 granted a visa. This theory is popular due to the high stake
 tension that existed during the Kennedy presidency including
 the Cuban Missle Crisis, the Bay of Pigs incident, etc. Cuba
 appeared as an easy perpetrator with clear motive to get rid
 of JFK.Despite the correlation, the US government determined
 in 1963 , that there was no Cuban involvement.
